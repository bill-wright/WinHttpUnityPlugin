# WinHttpUnityPlugin
It is made for ability to use windows current credentials (NTLM/Kerberos under Windows platform) without asking for them while interop with servers where Windows Authentication is enabled.
It is simple (and my first C++ expirience) plugin which supports only two types of requests:
* GET - to get data from server with JSON response
* POST - to send data to server with JSON body.

This project is in alpha stage and implements now only my needs.
